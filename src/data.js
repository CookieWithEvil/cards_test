The good lilac just beyond the house
hangs in bloom like a lace dress.
With no one home, I gather
my young body from the closet,
smell every floral and vased death,
fit loose my sister’s robin’s egg
skirt around my waist. Quiet,
in her unlit room, I go tenderly
to the mirror, my bare collarbone
a trickled pond of redbirds
that will ribbon unsoftly with time—
but here, now, I am seven, and love
so deeply a boy in second grade,
I need to be pretty in the dark`,

    text: `(By Cindy Juyoung Ok) \n
Several of my bones have splintered or
separated and been left to heal incorrectly
on their own, mostly in childhood. Of course
the analyst believes this to be symbolic
of my habitual denial of pain or, indeed,
vulnerability, but she cannot admit this directly.
She asks me leading questions like, am I truly
feeling the feeling of suffering, which I
find difficult to imagine. If I’m not feeling
my pain, then who or what is the me in my?
Instead, I announce that my partner comments
often that I never complain and rarely experience
side effects of a medication or symptoms
of an illness. By providing evidence for her
claim, I hope to lead her to accidentally provide
some reasoning. I know she believes this hope
for narrative arrangement, too, reflects repression
of some deep ache. Still, I imagine physical pain
as an intellectual relief, whereby thought stops
being a primary expression. I read that Asian
patients require less analgesic than the European
ones and wonder about what I want, my Asian
patience, against what I require. My nose broken
twice created a sort of suffocating zigzag,
permanent purple band along my bridge, so
light it is imperceptible to almost everyone.
An elbow to my face in front of a group made
them suddenly concerned, so I smiled to render
such disquiet unnecessary. I could not assume
their concern was real, which is to say lasting,
and I held, as I hold now, pain as ultimately
shallow, never indicative of anything but itself.`,

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

    title: "The Road Not Taken",
    text: `(By Robert Frost)\n
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.`,
